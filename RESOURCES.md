SETTING LAYOUTS FOR SPECIFIC VIEW/CONTROLLER USING SPECIFIC CSS STYLE
https://howilearnedrails.wordpress.com/2013/12/27/how-to-override-and-customize-the-devise-controller-in-rails/
(Also, need to add in config/initializers/assets - 'Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( new_session.css )')

RUN RAKE ROUTES ASSETS:PRECOMPILE BEFORE DEPLOYING SO CSS IS BUNDLED

ADDING DIFFERENT CLASSES ON TOP OF ORIGINAL INTERPOLATED RUBY
%= f.text_field :email, nil, :autofocus => true, :placeholder => "Your email Here", :class => "active", :style => "color: #333;" %>
